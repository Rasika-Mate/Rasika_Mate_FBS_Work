# 4. Calculate the cost of painting the following buildingâ€™s walls (both interior and exterior). You need to accept area (one wall) and cost of both interior and exterior wall.
# (Note: 1. Below diagram is of two joint rooms. 2. It is upper view of building.)

area = float(input("Enter area of one wall: "))

# 8 interior walls
int_cost = 8*area*ci

# 7 exterior walls (1 common wall not painted)
ext_cost = 7*area*ce
